# Metabolic-Pathway-Class-Prediction
Designing reaction predictors for synthesising novel molecules requires the knowledge of the processes and structural mappings between molecules and pathway classes. The problem of predicting classes of metabolic pathways in which a given biochemical compound participates is addressed in this project work. We employ a hybrid graph based deep learning model called Graph Convolutional networks (GCN) to predict the metabolic pathway classes of the molecules. Unlike previously used machine learning approaches for this problem, our model extracts important shape features using RDKit directly from input SMILES representations, which are atom-bond specifications of the chemical structures that make up the molecules.
